## Mods
**_[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Last Day — Translation [0.11.2]](http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-last-day/downloads/last-day-english-translation)_**<br/>
*Tranlates the mod to English*<br/>
<br/>
**_[TRX: Fixes 'n' Tweaks (6.5) [LD 1.3 +Patch]](http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-last-day/addons/trx-fixes-improvements-last-day-13-patch)_**<br/>
Optional Tweaks:
- Feature - Choose the Route You're Paying For
- Feature - DRX Dynamic Faction Relations
- Sounds - Restore Anomalies Beeping Sound

**_[Call of Misery English Voices Addon (1.5)](http://www.moddb.com/mods/call-of-chernobyl/addons/coc-english-voices-addon)_**<br/>
*Adds in English Voices. Used all sound files so NPCs will probably have multiple voices.*<br/>
<br/>
**_[CoM Mutant Ambient Sound Removal [1.0d+]](http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-com/addons/com-mutant-ambient-sound-removal)_**<br/>
*Removes the random ambient mutant sounds (like bloodsucker roar etc) you hear when walking around even though the mutant isn't actually there. Supposed to be scary but just annoying.*<br/>
<br/>
**_[Last Day 1.3+ Last Wishes 15](http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-last-day/addons/last-day-13-last-wishes)_**<br/>
**Last Wish Traders**<br>
*Gives traders a slightly better selection so there isnt as much RNG when buying equipment, food etc. Lowers goodwill needed for better tiers. Installed version that just adds stock and lowers goodwill, not all stock.*
>Traders will have more selections and high quantities available for misc items and equipment. Armor and weapons selections are spread out more now so you wont be seeing any modern or new weapons in supply level 2 for example (few exceptions), however all trader supply levels require less goodwill making further supply levels easier to reach. Last Wishes traders have a max of 1000 goodwill and start upgrading their supply at 400 goodwill with each new supply level earned every 200 goodwill after (1000,800,600,400).

**Last Wish Less Spongy Monsters**<br>
*Boars suck at extremely low level. Makes it easier when first starting out but they will still mess you up good.*
>Reduced damage resistance for boar, burer, chimera, flesh, giant and snork. resistances were lowered about 1/3 or 1/4 so they should no longer eat shotgun blasts to the face and just shrug it off.

**_[QoL Addons for LD [1.3+]](http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-last-day/addons/qol-addons-for-ld-13)_**<br/>
**OTHER - No blackouts and input blocks**<br/>
*Disables camera blackout and input block when using items and putting on gear.*<br/>
<br/>
**_[TRX: Global Weather (2.1)](http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-last-day/addons/trx-global-weather)_**<br/>
*Synchronizes weather throughout the Zone*<br/>
## My Mods
**_English Duty Loudspeaker_**<br/>
*Restores Duty propaganda and announcments in the Bar/Duty area. So now you can hear more about deadly anomalies, dangerous mutants, anarchists, and bandits!*<br/>
`gamedata\sounds\characters_voice\scenario\bar\megafon`<br/>
<br/>
**_Remove Near Death Aurora Borealis Effect_**<br/>
*Removes the Aurora Borealis effect (which is an amped up Alchohol effect) that happens when you reach below 30% health. Supposed to make is challenging but is more annoying. Might find a better effect later.*<br/>
