<text>%c[0,0,255,30]Information\n%c[0,140,140,140]Steel wool, also known as wire wool or wire sponge, is a bundle of strands of very fine soft steel filaments. It is used as an abrasive in finishing and repair work for polishing wood or metal objects, cleaning household cookware, and sanding in light painting. Steel wool is made from low-carbon steel (carbon content is low enough to be close to plain iron). It is not made by drawing "steel wool wire" through a tapered die, but rather by a process more like broaching where a heavy steel wire is pulled through a toothed die that removes a thin wire shaving. Bundles of steel wool can be used in precision equipment cleaning and to improve spreading of lubricants and cleaning solvents.\n \n

<text>%c[0,0,255,30]Information\n%c[0,140,140,140]Grease is a semisolid lubricant. It generally consists of a soap emulsified with mineral or vegetable oil. Greases are applied to mechanisms that cannot be lubricated constantly or where typical lubricating oil would not stay in position. They also act as sealants to prevent ingress of water and incompressible materials. Grease-lubricated bearings have greater frictional characteristics due to their high viscosity.\n \n

<text>%c[0,0,255,30]Information\n%c[0,140,140,140]Adolf Hitler's strategic memoires collected in a single book. The book and all that it stands for are hated by many, which makes this an item of high symbolic value. Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 - 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician and the leader of the National Socialist German Workers Party (German: Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), commonly referred to as the Nazi Party). He was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and dictator of Nazi Germany (as Fuhrer und Reichskanzler) from 1934 to 1945. Hitler is responsible for the founding of Nazism, the start of World War II, and the Holocaust.\n \n

Serves many purposes, but is mainly used to create small and simple tent-like hideouts. Trading value is low due to easily found alternatives.\n \n
