<text>%c[0,0,255,30]Information\n%c[0,140,140,140]At first glance, this backpack appears to have no outstanding properties. However, items placed located it lose their weight over time. Rumor has it that it is the result of a shipment of backpacks for the military, accidentally getting caught in an anomaly. Attempts by scientists of recreating its unique properties have failed. Batches of anomalous backpacks have been purchased by influential people in the Zone, which have continued to export them around the globe.\n \n

Anyone who has ever tried to light a fire in the open air knows that random gusts of wind can extinguish the flames very quickly. The firestarter set allows you to create a small but steady hearth fire, the temperature of which is significantly higher than that of paper or wax. An indispensable thing in any campaign, because it easy to light up even in the wet.\n \n \n

The box has been permanently crumpled, crumbling sulfur and broken wet matches. Only a quarter of its contents remains usable. Even so, lighting a fire or a cigarette is very difficult if using the matchbox - thus, stalkers tend to purchase a more expensive but practical lighter.\n \n

<text>%c[0,0,255,30]Information\n%c[0,140,140,140]PFM-1 used to be a standard-issue anti-personnel mine of the Red Army, employed mainly during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Its widespread utilization during the conflict led to high civilian casualties, especially among children, since randomly scattered mines were often mistaken for toys due to their familiar shape and color. For this reason, the PFM-1 earned a sinister nickname: "Child killer." Since then, the mine has been replaced by newer models. However, as was the case with a variety of other 'retired' weaponry, a large number of these mines has somehow made its way into the Zone, becoming its primary booby-trap explosive. The mine is highly valued mainly for its functionality, user-friendliness, compact size and low weight, while its main drawback is a relatively small amount of explosive material: its power is often insufficient to kill a heavily armored stalker with a single blast. For this reason, the mine should be used in combination with other explosive materials and it acts as an igniter. If it is not armed, the mine will not detonate, even when hit with a gun.\n \n

While some Zoners are still trying to make the wrecks work again, others have found alternate ways of utilizing the jerrycans, namely, as improvised explosives. Upon direct hit, the canister will catch fire and explode after a slight delay. Although heavy and cumbersome, it is extremely powerful, and a well-placed jerrycan can be lethal even if the target wears the heaviest of body armors. On the other hand, the explosion is often so potent that the killer becomes the victim himself, so it's best to use these canisters with caution. There are rumors that a veteran stalker named Yuya once saved his skin by luring a pseudogiant into a jerrycan trap. He emptied his last Makarov magazine and the giant burst into flames with a roar that was heard throughout the Jupiter.\n \n
